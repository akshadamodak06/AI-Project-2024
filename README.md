# AI Project 2024 â€” DAU AI Club Summer Program

This repository showcases my work completed as part of the **AI Club Summer Program 2024** at DAU. Over a structured four-week curriculum, I designed, implemented, and documented a series of machine learning pipelines entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**, progressing from foundational Python to advanced supervised learning workflows. The project culminated in a Kaggle challenge on IMDB movie rating prediction.

## Week-by-Week Overview

### Week 1: Python Foundations and Scientific Libraries
- Refreshed and expanded skills in **Python programming** for data science applications.
- Explored and practiced with essential Python libraries:
  - **NumPy** for efficient numerical computation
  - **Pandas** for powerful data manipulation and cleaning
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- Developed modular and reusable code with a focus on clear, reproducible Jupyter notebooks.

---

### Week 2: Supervised Learning Concepts
- Gained a solid grasp of supervised machine learning:
  - Classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
  - Regression techniques: Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Understood the mathematical intuition behind loss functions and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.).
- Implemented these algorithms with **scikit-learn**, building end-to-end pipelines with train/test splitting, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis & Real-World Projects
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on diverse datasets:
  - Diabetes dataset (classification)
  - Real estate dataset (regression)
- Applied advanced visualization techniques to detect outliers, correlations, and data distribution patterns.
- Engineered meaningful features through domain-driven insights to improve model accuracy.
- Practiced:
  - Missing value imputation strategies
  - Feature selection approaches
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation.

### Week 4: Kaggle IMDB Movie Rating Prediction
- Applied the cumulative skillset to a Kaggle challenge focused on predicting IMDB movie ratings.
- Developed a robust machine learning pipeline including:
  - Data cleaning and outlier handling
  - Exploratory visualizations with **Seaborn**
  - Advanced feature engineering (handling categorical features, transforming skewed variables)
  - Model training and hyperparameter optimization with **scikit-learn**
- Documented the entire workflow in Jupyter Notebook, providing interpretable insights and visualizations to communicate model results effectively.
